Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)

CHILD	Candiescount	Probability
A	         1	         0.015
B	         4	         0.20
C	         3	         0.65
D	         5	         0.005
E	         6	         0.01
F	         2	         0.120

**Solution:** 

Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child = 1 * 0.015 + 4*0.20 + 3*0.65 + 5*0.005 + 6 *0.01 + 2 * 0.12 = 0.015 + 0.8 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 3.090

Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient?

**Solution:** 

A. Expected Value = ∑ (probability * Value) = ∑ P(x). E(x) There are 9 patients, Probability of selecting each patient = 1/9 Ex: 108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199 P(x): 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 1/9 Expected Value = (1/9)*108 + (1/9)*110 + (1/9)*123 + (1/9)*134 + (1/9)*135 + (1/9)*145 + (1/9)*167 + (1/9)*187 + (1/9)199 = (1/9) (108 + 110 + 123 + 134 + 135 + 145 + 167 + 187 + 199) = (1/9)(1308) = 145.33 Expected Value of the Weight of that patient = 145.33

Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?

The skewness is zero when mean and median of data is equal.

Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median ?

When the value of mean is greater than median and mode then it is called positive skewed.

Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?

When the value of mean is less than median and mode then it is called negative skewed.

Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data ?

Positive values of kurtosis indicate that distribution is peaked and possesses thick tails. An extreme positive kurtosis indicates a distribution where more of the numbers are located in the tails of the distribution instead of around the mean.

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?

A distribution with a negative kurtosis value indicates that the distribution has lighter tails than the normal distribution.

Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.

Q. What can we say about the distribution of the data?

A. It is not normally distributed because median is towards the higher value

Q. What is nature of skewness of the data?

A. The data is a skewed towards left. The whisker range of minimum value is greater than maximum.

Q. What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)?

A. 18 – 10 = 8 (IQR = Q3 Upper quartile – Q1 Lower Quartile)
