Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
**Solution:** HHH, TTT, HHT, TTH, HTT, THH, HTH, THT
There will be 3 out of 8 probability that two heads and one tail can be obtained.

Q4) Two Dice are rolled, find the probability that sum is:
a)	Equal to 1 – 0 probability
b)	Less than or equal to 4 – 1/12
c)	Sum is divisible by 2 and 3 – 1/6

Q5) A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
**Solution:** 10/21

Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)

CHILD	Candiescount	Probability
A	         1	         0.015
B	         4	         0.20
C	         3	         0.65
D	         5	         0.005
E	         6	         0.01
F	         2	         0.120

**Solution:** 
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child = 1 * 0.015 + 4*0.20 + 3*0.65 + 5*0.005 + 6 *0.01 + 2 * 0.12 = 0.015 + 0.8 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 3.090

Q7) Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, Range &     comment about the values / draw inferences, for the given dataset
-	For Points, Score, Weigh>
Find Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Range and also Comment about the values/ Draw some inferences.
**Solution:**
 	Mean
